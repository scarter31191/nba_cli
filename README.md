# NbaCli

Welcome to the nba_Cli_gem.

This CLI Gem allows you to look up NBA teams by their name.

Team searches will display their name, full name, abbreviation, city, conference, and division. So if you search for "Knicks", you'll recieve the teams basic info.

From the team search you can look up another team on the list by entering another team name.

Hope you enjoy and please let me know if you would like a feature included.
